# Twitter Clone – MERN Stack

A full-stack Twitter clone built as part of my transition into MERN stack development, following modern best practices in frontend and backend architecture. This project's sole purpose is to showcase my learning curve in learning new tech stack and give me a goal to finish as learning by doing concept.

The application demonstrates my hands-on experience with React, Node.js, JWT authentication, real-time interactions, and modern UI development using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.
